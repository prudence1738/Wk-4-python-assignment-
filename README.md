# File Read & Write Challenge with User-Selected Modification

## Overview
This Python program reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file. The user can choose how to modify the content, making the program interactive and flexible. It also includes **error handling** to manage cases where the file doesnâ€™t exist or cannot be read.

## Features
- Reads content from a user-specified file
- Lets the user choose one of three modifications:
  1. Convert all text to **UPPERCASE**
  2. Convert all text to **lowercase**
  3. Add a **custom string** to each line
- Writes the modified content to a new file specified by the user
- Handles errors such as:
  - File not found
  - Permission errors
  - Other unexpected exceptions
